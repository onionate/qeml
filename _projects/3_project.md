Quantum Graph Pursuit (QGP) demonstrates the ability of quantum annealing to solve dynamic combinatorial optimization problems. Possible practical applications of QGP concern planning dynamic paths in discrete contexts and navigating a dynamic environment where obstacles or goals move over time. Our experiments showed that hybrid quantum annealing can provide optimal solutions to the problem considering graphs with a non-trivial number of nodes. Full quantum executions could be adopted only for significantly smaller problem instances but show the feasibility of the approach on the long term. The experiments have been executed on real quantum hardware offered by D-Wave.
